# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis with Power BI

## 📌 Project Summary
This project explores Airbnb listings to uncover insights on pricing, occupancy, amenities, and revenue performance.  
Using **Power BI**, I created interactive dashboards that allow users to analyze key factors influencing short-term rental performance across different cities and property types.  

## 🚀 How to Explore This Project
1. Open the **Power BI file** located in the `/reports` folder.
2. Use slicers to filter by:
   - City / Zipcode  
   - Month / Year  
   - Host type (Single unit, Multi-unit, etc.)  
   - Property characteristics (Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Guests)  
3. Review the dashboards for:
   - **Top 10 Revenue Properties**
   - **Occupancy vs Price Trends**
   - **Common Amenities & Their Impact**
   - **Revenue per Available Listing (RevPAL) Analysis**

## 📊 Key Insights
- Multi-unit hosts generally achieve **higher revenue** than single-unit hosts.  
- Certain amenities (Hottubs & pool) strongly correlate with **higher occupancy**.  
- Revenue performance varies significantly by **seasonality and location**.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** → Data visualization and dashboards  
- **Power Query** → Data cleaning and transformation
